In order to help you guys with creating our program, we have added a few tips below!

You will have to create a love calculator that return a percentage after an input of two names.
In order to do this you will need to come up with an algorithm that uses all the following functions:

--
+ for concatenation
.equals(String) -> to compare a string to a speciefied object
.substring(startPos, endPos) -> return the letters between startPos and endPos
.length() -> find the lenght value for the name (UpperCase and LowerCase)
.indexOf(String) -> return the index within a string of a character
.compareTo(String) -> compare the two values (UpperCase and LowerCase)
.toUpperCase() -> translate the name to UpperCase to find the lenght with .length()
.toLowerCase() -> translate the name to LowerCase to find the lenght with .length()
