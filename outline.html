<p>The goal is to create a script which will compare two names (inputs)
and give the percentage compatibility (using strings and comparing them).

Hint: use ASCII values (convert string to total value then compare, just sayin'.)

We will need to find use for the following strings:
-
--
---
+ for concatenation
.equals(String)
.substring(startPos, endPos)
.length()
.indexOf(String)
.compareTo(String)
.toUpperCase()
.toLowerCase()
---
--
-

For the sake of uniformity, when the two strings "giovanni" & "leti" are compared, 
the percentage outputted should equal:  xx%.

Take that into account when coding your program, and remember that you must use all string methods stated above.

Good luck.</p>
